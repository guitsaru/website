Phoenix LiveView is a great new addition to the Phoenix ecosystem. I wanted to
make a small sample project to see how close we can get to the single page application
that's achievable with JavaScript frameworks like Vue or React. Throughout my career
I've always found REST API client applications to be extremely useful, so I thought
I would see how much I could get done in a few hours of work. I've open sourced
the project as an example for others to learn from. Check it out and let me know what
you think!
